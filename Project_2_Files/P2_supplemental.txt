Q1.1 (Kevin Nguyen & Ibrahim Mohammad): 

The ReflexAgent evaluates each possible action by generating the successor state and assigning a score based on an evaluation function. 
We improved it by enhancing the evaluation function to prioritize eating food (rewarding food consumption), minimizing distance to the nearest food, 
avoiding ghosts (penalizing proximity unless they are scared), and encouraging movement (penalizing stopping). Additionally, we added stronger 
rewards for chasing scared ghosts and adjusted penalties for risky moves near active ghosts.

Q1.2 (Kevin Nguyen & Ibrahim Mohammad): 

The value function rewards states with fewer remaining food pellets, closer proximity to food, 
and greater distance from active ghosts. It heavily penalizes stopping and being near active ghosts while providing bonuses for eating 
food and chasing scared ghosts. This estimation makes sense because it encourages Pacman to efficiently clear the board by staying safe from ghosts, 
quickly consuming food, and leveraging power pellets for ghost hunting.
